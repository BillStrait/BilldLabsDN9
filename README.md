## Project Goals

This project is made to practice some concepts that are new and/or underused. We also want to embrace the concept of Indie Web and Omnipublishing. The finished product should have the following features in  under a week, using the minimal required 3rd parties (IE no oAuth, no facebook tracking pixel, no 3rd party libraries that track users).

1. Blazor Interactive Server/Static Server rendering
    * The goal is to make the page load reasonably fast for new and returning users.
2. Blog-Like experience to visiting users. Administrators will be able to write, categorize, and publish (internally and externally) articles and reviews.
    * We would like to begin with a 'Comic Cover/Comic Review' template. There should also be a 'Dev Log' (not final name) template to talk about programming topics, and an Errata - We will want to add additional templates in the future.
3. RSS Feeds
    * We want to provide feeds of each category, and the site as a whole to users. Optionally, we would like to allow users to create custom RSS feeds by combining categories theyh are interested in.
4. Omnipublish.
    * Every blog post should be summarized and send to BSky/Mastodon/Other Services as Identified
5. Keypass authentication
    * We want to use Keypass, it is the future.
6. AI Integration
    * We want to be able to generate a summary of the post, either using important phrases from the document or by  having the AI write a summary, that will fit under the bsky/mastodon character counts.
